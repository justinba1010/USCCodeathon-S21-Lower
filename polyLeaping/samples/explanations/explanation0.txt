There is 1 test case here. The shape has 3 sides, and the jump size is 2. (This is the first example shown above by the picture with the square). There were 2 sides untouched, so 2 is printed.


There are 2 test cases. The first one describes a shape with 5 sides, and the jump size is 4 (this is the second example shown by a picture above). Every side is hit, so there were 0 sides untouched, so 0 is printed.

In the second case, the shape has 8 sides, and the jump size is 10. There are 4 sides left untouched, so 4 is printed.
