# Example

Here is an example of a full problem. It includes a custom checker for Hackerrank(optional), input generation, and two solutions.
Put solutions in the solution folder, and try to write solutions for other problems using similar and different ideas, slower/faster,
for most problems it is good to have a brute force solution that is guaranteed to be correct to check reasonably sized inputs.

# Summy

## Description

Find the minimum and maximum sums that can be made out of the list of numbers.

## Problem Statement

You are given a list of numbers. And a `k`, which will tell you the size of the sublists you need to find. Your goal is to find the minimum possible sum of `k` elements from the `n` element list and maximum.

## Input Format

```
n k
i_1 i_2 i_3 ... i_n
```

## Constraints

$1 < k < n < 500000$
$-100 <= i <= 100$

## Output Format

```
a
b
```
Where $a$ is the minimum possible sum of k elements, and $b$ is the maximum sum of k elements.
